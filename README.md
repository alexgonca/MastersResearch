Master's Research
=================

During my Master's, I studied computer-assisted framing analysis. In this repository, you can find all source code generated during my research.

My Master's thesis is [available online](http://casadecachorro.com.br/alex/thesis.pdf). I used a recent controversy in the Brazilian media to test my methods: the *rolezinhos* -- flashmobs organized by low-income youth in Brazilian shopping malls.
