Master's Research
=================

During my Master's, I studied computer-assisted framing analysis. My Master's thesis is [available online](http://casadecachorro.com.br/alex/thesis.pdf). I used a recent controversy in Brazilian media (the *rolezinhos*: flashmobs organized by low-income youth in Brazilian shopping malls) to test the methods I developed in my research.

In this repository, you can find all source code generated during my research. The code is organized in folders that are described as follows.

# mediacloud

My research largely relied on [Media Cloud](http://www.mediacloud.org) data. In fact, I helped to [localize Media Cloud](https://github.com/alexgonca/MediaCloudLocalization) to the Brazilian media ecosystem. The folder [mediacloud](mediacloud) has the Python code for creating the corpus used in my research. It was implemented with the [MediaCloud Python API](https://github.com/c4fcm/MediaCloud-API-Client).
